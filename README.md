# Welcome

This FastAPI application provides a comprehensive solution for managing city and temperature data. It consists of two main components:

City CRUD API: Manage city data with endpoints to create, read, update, and delete city records. The City model includes fields for id, name, and additional_info, with data stored in a SQLite database.

Temperature API: Fetch and store current temperature data for cities using an external resource. It includes endpoints to update temperature records, retrieve all temperature data, and get records for specific cities. The Temperature model features id, city_id, date_time, and temperature.
